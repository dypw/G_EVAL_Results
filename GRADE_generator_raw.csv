Evaluation Crieteria:
Coherence:(1-5) Is the response coherent with the context?
A score of 1 response is completely inappropriate for context. 
A score of 2 means The response still does not match the context, but at least there are some related or similar topics.
A score of 3 means The response to some extent corresponds to the context, but the entire conversation appears to be fluid.
A score of 4 means the response is coherent with the context while not that perfect.
A score of 5 means the response is completely coherent with the context.
Evaluation Steps:
1. Read the Conversation, the Golden Response and the Response carefully.
2. Rate the Response on a scale of 1-5 for coherence, according to the criteria above.
Provide a brief explanation for your rating, referring to specific aspects of the response and the conversation.
Example:\nConversation History:\nSpeaker A:Me ?

I'm not kidding .\nResponse (to be evaluated):\nI just had a quarrel with him .\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n- Coherence:",3.6,"2\nExplanation: The response has some relevance in the context as Speaker A is expressing a strong negative reaction towards someone or something. However, it's not fully coherent because the exact reason for Speaker A's behaviour is not mentioned in the previous conversation and ""a quarrel"" seems to lead to another direction. The golden response provides an explanation related to 'circus', which is not hinted in the evaluated response."

Explanation: The response is almost perfect as it is pointing towards the action of wrapping up the items and providing the receipt the speaker B asked for. However, it can be confusing because the phrase ""here is it"" can also refer to the actual item Speaker B is buying, rather than the receipt. The ambiguity slightly affects the coherence."

What's the problem ?\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n- Coherence:",3.7,"3 Explanation: The response somewhat matches with the context of the conversation, as speaker B is still struggling to understand speaker A's query about amenities. However, it doesn't directly answer Speaker A's question or provide any proposed solution or further inquiry about specifically what amenities are being sought. Thus, the conversation seems less fluid because the response doesn't completely catch the main point of the conversation."

Explanation: The provided response does seem to somewhat correspond with the context, in that it appears to be encouraging Speaker B to try something on. However, it is not a perfect match in terms of anticipating Speaker B's needs in this scenario - instead of directly offering help or giving directions as is done in the golden response, the speaker merely gives a personal opinion about Speaker B's possible liking for the item. This makes the conversation seem somewhat less fluid than it could be.

However, the introduction of porridge in their response seems out of place. As Speaker B was discussing their preference for fruits and vegetables, it would have been more coherent for Speaker A to continue on that track or inquire about another type of healthy food. The score of 3 is because the response still makes sense in a general conversation about food, but is not perfectly aligned with the context.

The speaker acknowledges having a fever, and while they contradict Speaker B's assessment of it being a high fever, it is not entirely out of context to express a varying opinion on the severity of their condition. They are both still discussing the topic of the speaker's health. However, the response is not completely coherent as it doesn't address the full question asked by Speaker B about potential additional symptoms."

A score of 1 response is completely inappropriate for context. 
A score of 2 means The response still does not match the context, but at least there are some related or similar topics.
A score of 3 means The response to some extent corresponds to the context, but the entire conversation appears to be fluid.
A score of 4 means the response is coherent with the context while not that perfect.
A score of 5 means the response is completely coherent with the context.

Here, the surprise of Speaker B not knowing that Deborah was pregnant could be implied. However, the phrasing of the response results in a not perfectly coherent conversation, since it seems to imply Deborah's pregnancy was a secret or a guessing game, when the conversation history does not provide such information.

The main attraction for this model is the fuel economy .\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n- Coherence:",3.4,"1 Explanation: The response given does not match the conversation context. Speaker A and B are discussing auto-reverse (likely a feature on a device such as a cassette player) and its tendency to break easily. The provided response talks about the affordability and fuel economy of a car, which is unrelated to the original topic.

Explanation: The response is somewhat related to the context of a phone conversation.

The response doesn't correspond with what is happening in the conversation as Speaker A saying they'll call back later does not make sense when they are supposed to be waiting on the line."

Coffee ?\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n- Coherence:",3.1,"1

The repetition does not contribute anything new or relevant to the ongoing conversation."
